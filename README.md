# space-camp-form-validation
Space-themed sign up form, complete with client-side form validation and customisable error messages.

# Motivation

I created this project to try out something cool with CSS animations and try and give the user the illusion of motion. I felt that doing this was also a chance to practice responsive web design by ensuring that the form worked well on smaller screens too whilst remaining legible.

It was also a chance for me to use some JavaScript that I rarely get to use and create custom validation errors for the form.

# Tech used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project.#

# Features
The moving background makes this project stand out. I could imagine this being repurposed to perhaps show a rotating Earth or maybe even a sky view from an aeroplane.

# Credits
I got inspired to build this after seeing [Brad Traversy's Form Validator from his Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/form-validator), so I've been heavily influenced by that.

I looked at his code, recreated it exactly, wrote down the project specifications, and then created this form from scratch based solely on those project specifications. Any other similarities are purely coincidental.
